<h1>The Guide Group Privacy Policy</h1>

<div>

  <div>
    <h2>Introduction & Scope</h2>
    <div>
      Last Updated: September 1, 2025<br>
      This Privacy Policy explains how The Guide Group (the “Site”, “we”, “our”, or “us”) collects, uses, discloses, and safeguards information about users (“you”) when you access or use our website, booking flows, communications channels, and related services (collectively, the “Services”). By using the Services, you acknowledge you have read and understood this Policy. If you do not agree, please discontinue use.<br>
      This Policy applies to data we process as the coordinator/contact point for bookings and support. <b>We are not the contracting party for on-the-day guiding services.</b> Assigned guides (independent professionals) may act as separate controllers/processors for their own records and legal obligations. Their privacy practices may differ; please review any guide-provided notices where applicable.
    </div>
  </div>

  <div>
    <h2>Categories of Information We Collect</h2>
    <div>
      Depending on your interactions, we may collect the following categories of information:<br>
      <b>1) Identifiers & Contact Data</b>: name, alias, nationality, email, phone, messaging app IDs, company details for receipts.<br>
      <b>2) Booking & Transaction Data</b>: itinerary requests, group size, dates, meeting points, special notes; deposit payment status, partial receipts (for deposit/handling fee only).<br>
      <b>3) Preferences & Trip Details</b>: dietary or accessibility needs, language preferences, mobility considerations.<br>
      <b>4) Communications</b>: emails, live chat transcripts, call or meeting logistics (time, participants, non-content metadata).<br>
      <b>5) Technical & Usage Data</b>: IP address, device and browser type, operating system, referring/exit pages, timestamps, pages viewed, clickstream, approximate geolocation, cookies/SDK identifiers, session diagnostics, fraud indicators.<br>
      <b>6) User-Submitted Content</b>: feedback, survey responses, uploaded documents (e.g., accessibility confirmations), optional media you provide.<br>
      <b>7) Inferences</b>: derived insights about service preferences and likely interests based on the above data.<br>
      <b>8) Sensitive Data</b> (only if you choose to provide): allergy/medical notes strictly for coordination. Do not provide more than necessary; avoid sharing highly sensitive documents unless requested for safety/compliance and transmitted via secure methods we specify.
    </div>
  </div>

  <div>
    <h2>Sources of Information</h2>
    <div>
      We collect information from: (a) you directly (forms, messages, calls), (b) your use of the Services (logs, cookies), (c) assigned guides regarding booking fulfillment status and coordination notes, (d) payment processors for deposit transactions, (e) publicly available sources where lawful (e.g., business contact data you publish), and (f) with your consent, third-party platforms you choose to connect (e.g., video meeting tools).
    </div>
  </div>

  <div>
    <h2>Legal Bases for Processing (where applicable)</h2>
    <div>
      Where required (e.g., EEA/UK), our legal bases may include: <b>contract necessity</b> (to provide/coordinate Services you request), <b>legitimate interests</b> (e.g., security, service improvement, anti-fraud, quality control), <b>consent</b> (e.g., certain marketing analytics), and <b>legal obligations</b> (e.g., accounting, tax, compliance requests). We balance our interests against your rights and expectations and provide opt-outs where required.
    </div>
  </div>

  <div>
    <h2>How We Use Information</h2>
    <div>
      We use information to: (1) operate and improve the Services; (2) coordinate bookings, assign guides, confirm itineraries; (3) process deposit payments and issue deposit receipts; (4) communicate updates, logistics, and support; (5) personalize suggestions (e.g., accessibility, dining); (6) protect against fraud, abuse, or security incidents; (7) comply with laws and enforce terms; (8) conduct analytics, quality assurance, and training; and (9) maintain business records and backups. We may de-identify or aggregate information for research, statistics, and service enhancement.
    </div>
  </div>

  <div>
    <h2>Cookies & Similar Technologies</h2>
    <div>
      We use cookies, local storage, and similar technologies to keep you signed in, remember preferences, analyze traffic, and improve performance. You can manage cookies via your browser settings. Blocking some cookies may impair certain features. Where required by law, we will present a consent banner allowing you to accept, reject, or customize non-essential cookies.
    </div>
  </div>

  <div>
    <h2>Analytics, Performance & Anti-Fraud</h2>
    <div>
      We may use analytics and measurement tools to understand usage and improve the Services. We also employ anti-fraud and abuse-detection measures (e.g., anomaly and reputation checks) to protect users and our platform. These tools may set cookies or collect technical identifiers. We do not sell personal information for monetary consideration. Where “sharing” for cross-context behavioral advertising is regulated, you may have opt-out rights (see “Your Rights & Choices”).
    </div>
  </div>

  <div>
    <h2>Payments & Financial Information</h2>
    <div>
      Deposit payments are processed through third-party payment processors. We do not store full card numbers on our servers. We receive limited payment metadata (e.g., transaction status) for reconciliation and support. For business clients, we may issue a receipt for the <b>deposit/handling fee portion only</b>. The remaining 50% is payable directly to the assigned guide; any receipts for that portion must be obtained from the guide.
    </div>
  </div>

  <div>
    <h2>How We Share Information</h2>
    <div>
      We may disclose information as follows:<br>
      <b>Guides (Independent Professionals)</b>: to coordinate your booking, logistics, preferences, and safety-related notes. Guides are independent and may process your data under their own obligations and policies.<br>
      <b>Service Providers/Processors</b>: hosting, customer support, communications, analytics, security, payments, email providers, document storage—under appropriate contractual safeguards.<br>
      <b>Business Transfers</b>: in connection with mergers, acquisitions, reorganizations, or asset sales, subject to confidentiality and continued protection.<br>
      <b>Legal & Safety</b>: to comply with law, court orders, or lawful requests; to protect our rights, safety, users, or the public; to investigate suspected wrongdoing or policy violations.<br>
      <b>With Consent</b>: where you direct us to share or consent to specific disclosures.<br>
      We do <b>not</b> sell personal information for money. We may share de-identified or aggregated data for insights and service improvement.
    </div>
  </div>

  <div>
    <h2>International Transfers</h2>
    <div>
      We may process and store information in jurisdictions outside your own. Where required, we implement appropriate safeguards (e.g., standard contractual clauses, risk assessments, supplementary measures). By using the Services, you understand your data may be transferred internationally subject to such protections and applicable law.
    </div>
  </div>

  <div>
    <h2>Data Retention</h2>
    <div>
      We retain information for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this Policy, including providing Services, complying with legal obligations, resolving disputes, maintaining records, and enforcing agreements. Retention periods vary by data category and context. When no longer needed, we will delete, anonymize, or securely store data until deletion is feasible. We may retain aggregated or de-identified information indefinitely for legitimate business purposes.
    </div>
  </div>

  <div>
    <h2>Security</h2>
    <div>
      We implement administrative, technical, and physical safeguards designed to protect information against unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure, or destruction. However, no method of transmission or storage is 100% secure. <b>We cannot guarantee absolute security</b>. Please use strong passwords, keep your devices secure, and avoid sending sensitive data via unsecured channels unless we explicitly provide a secure mechanism.
    </div>
  </div>

  <div>
    <h2>Children’s Privacy</h2>
    <div>
      The Services are not directed to children below the age at which parental consent is required by applicable law. We do not knowingly collect personal information from such children without appropriate consent. If you believe a child has provided personal information without consent, please contact us so we can take appropriate steps to remove the information where required by law.
    </div>
  </div>

  <div>
    <h2>Your Rights & Choices</h2>
    <div>
      Depending on your location, you may have rights such as: access, correction, deletion, portability, restriction/objection to processing, and withdrawal of consent. For certain jurisdictions (e.g., EEA/UK), you may also object to processing based on legitimate interests and lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority. Where applicable (e.g., certain U.S. states), you may opt out of “selling” or “sharing” for cross-context behavioral advertising. We will not discriminate against you for exercising your rights.<br>
      To exercise rights or manage preferences (including marketing communications and cookies, where available), please contact us via the methods in “Contact Us”. We may need to verify your identity and request limited information to process your request. Some data may be exempt from deletion (e.g., legal compliance, security, fraud prevention, or transactional records).
    </div>
  </div>

  <div>
    <h2>Do Not Track & Global Privacy Controls</h2>
    <div>
      Some browsers transmit “Do Not Track” (DNT) signals. There is no industry consensus on how to respond to such signals. Where required by applicable law, we will honor legally recognized browser-based opt-out signals (e.g., certain Global Privacy Control signals) for relevant processing activities, subject to verification and technical feasibility.
    </div>
  </div>

  <div>
    <h2>Third-Party Links & Services</h2>
    <div>
      The Services may contain links to third-party websites, tools, or platforms (e.g., booking tools, payment gateways, video meeting apps). We are not responsible for the privacy practices of those third parties. Your use of third-party services is subject to their own terms and policies. Please review them carefully before providing personal information or enabling integrations.
    </div>
  </div>

  <div>
    <h2>Role Clarification: The Guide Group vs. Guides</h2>
    <div>
      The Guide Group acts as a <b>coordinator/contact point</b> for booking and support and is <b>not a party to the service contract</b> between you and the assigned guide. For privacy purposes, The Guide Group may be a controller for data it collects and uses to operate the Services (e.g., deposits, coordination, support). Assigned guides are independent professionals who may act as separate controllers for their own compliance (e.g., local legal or tax obligations, on-tour incident records). Please contact the assigned guide for their records and receipts regarding the on-day remaining 50% payment and any local privacy notices they apply.
    </div>
  </div>

  <div>
    <h2>Data Accuracy & Minimization</h2>
    <div>
      You are responsible for ensuring the information you provide is current, accurate, and limited to what is necessary for coordination and safety. Please avoid sending excessive or unrelated personal information. If your details change, promptly update us so we can maintain accurate records for your booking and support needs.
    </div>
  </div>

  <div>
    <h2>Data Breach & Incident Response</h2>
    <div>
      We maintain procedures to detect, assess, and respond to potential data incidents. Where required by law, we will notify affected individuals and/or authorities, taking into account the nature of the data, risk to individuals, and applicable timelines. We are not liable for incidents arising from factors beyond our reasonable control, including failures of third-party networks, providers, or your devices/configurations.
    </div>
  </div>

  <div>
    <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <div>
      We may update this Policy from time to time to reflect changes in our practices, technologies, or legal requirements. The “Last Updated” date indicates the latest revision. Material changes will be communicated through the Services or by other appropriate means. Your continued use after changes signifies acceptance of the updated Policy.
    </div>
  </div>

  <div>

    </div>
  </div>

  <div>
    <h2>Jurisdiction-Specific Notices</h2>
    <div>
      <b>EEA/UK</b>: You have the rights outlined under GDPR/UK GDPR, including access, rectification, erasure, restriction, objection, portability, and the right to lodge a complaint with your local supervisory authority. Where consent is the basis, you may withdraw consent at any time without affecting prior lawful processing.<br>
      <b>US State Laws</b> (where applicable): You may have rights to know/access, correct, delete, data portability, and opt out of certain data “sales” or “sharing” for cross-context behavioral advertising. We do not discriminate for exercising these rights. Authorized agents may submit requests with appropriate proof of authorization and identity verification.<br>
      <b>Japan</b>: Where the Personal Information Protection Law (APPI) applies, we will handle personal information in accordance with APPI principles, including specifying purposes of use, ensuring data security, and respecting requests for disclosure, correction, or cessation of use per applicable procedures.
    </div>
  </div>

  <div>
    <h2>Definitions</h2>
    <div>
      “Personal information” or “personal data” means information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person, as defined by applicable law.<br>
      “Processing” means any operation performed on personal data (e.g., collection, storage, use, disclosure).<br>
      “Controller” determines the purposes and means of processing; “processor” processes data on behalf of a controller.<br>
      “De-identified” or “aggregated” data is data that cannot reasonably be used to infer information about, or otherwise be linked to, a particular individual, subject to applicable law.
    </div>
  </div>

  <div>
    <h2>Limitations & Reservation of Rights</h2>
    <div>
      Nothing in this Policy creates any contractual right on your part beyond what is required by law. Our obligations are limited to the extent permitted by applicable law. We may decline requests where an exemption applies (e.g., legal privilege, security, fraud detection, or rights of others). We reserve the right to require reasonable authentication and to charge permitted fees for manifestly unfounded or excessive requests. The Services are provided on an “as-is” and “as-available” basis; see our Terms of Service for further limitations and disclaimers.
