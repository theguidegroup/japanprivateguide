    <p style="font-size: 1.1rem; line-height: 1.8;">
      <b>Senso-ji Temple</b> (浅草寺, Sensō-ji) is Tokyo’s oldest temple and one of Japan’s most visited spiritual landmarks. Located in the historic <b>Asakusa district</b>, this Buddhist temple is not only a revered religious site but also a vibrant cultural destination. Every year, millions of visitors from across the globe walk through its grand gates to experience a piece of Japan’s ancient soul.
    </p>

    <h2 style="color:#ff3399;">A Legacy That Began in the Year 645</h2>
    <p>
      Senso-ji was founded in the year <b>645 AD</b>, making it the oldest Buddhist temple in Tokyo. According to legend, two fishermen brothers discovered a statue of the bodhisattva Kannon (Goddess of Mercy) in the Sumida River. Despite their efforts to return it, the statue kept finding its way back. This miracle inspired the construction of a temple to honor Kannon, which would eventually grow into the majestic Senso-ji.
    </p>
    <p>
      Throughout Japan’s turbulent feudal eras, and even after being destroyed during World War II air raids, Senso-ji was always rebuilt—symbolizing the enduring spirit of Tokyo itself. The temple’s current structure is a post-war reconstruction, carefully restored to retain its original Edo-period grandeur.
    </p>

    <h2 style="color:#ff3399;">Architectural Highlights and Sacred Symbols</h2>
    <p>
      Walking through Senso-ji is like stepping into a living museum. The iconic <b>Kaminarimon (Thunder Gate)</b> welcomes visitors with its massive red lantern and fierce guardian statues, embodying protection and power. Beyond it lies <b>Nakamise Street</b>, a vibrant marketplace with centuries-old roots, lined with traditional snacks, handmade crafts, and local souvenirs.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the temple’s heart stands the <b>Main Hall (Hondō)</b>, where visitors offer prayers and burn incense in the hope of receiving blessings from Kannon. Nearby, the striking <b>Five-Story Pagoda</b> gracefully rises toward the sky, a symbol of Buddhist enlightenment. The purification fountain, fortune boxes (omikuji), and temple bells all invite quiet reflection and connection to ancient tradition.
    </p>

    <h2 style="color:#ff3399;">Cultural Events and Local Festivals</h2>
    <p>
      Senso-ji is the centerpiece of many traditional festivals. Most famous is the <b>Sanja Matsuri</b> in May, one of Tokyo’s biggest and most energetic Shinto festivals, featuring portable shrines (mikoshi), music, and parades through Asakusa’s lively streets.
    </p>
    <p>
      Seasonal events also include cherry blossom viewing in spring, lantern festivals in summer, and New Year’s temple visits (hatsumōde) where millions gather to make wishes for the year ahead. These celebrations make Senso-ji a vibrant cultural hub year-round.
