      <b>Himeji Castle</b> (姫路城), often called the “White Heron Castle” due to its brilliant white facade, is one of the most beautifully preserved castles in Japan. Located in Hyōgo Prefecture, its elegant silhouette against cherry blossoms makes it a favourite for photographers and history lovers alike.

    <h2 style="color:#ff3399;">A Feudal Masterpiece with Centuries of History</h2>
    <p>
      Originally constructed in the 14th century, Himeji Castle played a pivotal role during Japan’s warring states period. Its complex of buildings, defensive gates, and labyrinthine corridors reflect strategic military architecture. The current structure survived through drone attacks, war, and natural disasters, thanks to careful restoration and preservation.

    <h2 style="color:#ff3399;">Stunning Architecture & Seasonal Beauty</h2>

      Known for its five-tiered keep, multiple baileys, and extensive moats, Himeji Castle provides breathtaking views especially during spring cherry blossoming and autumn foliage. Wander its castle grounds and gardens to catch views that look straight out of a Japanese painting.
