    <h1 style="color:#ff3399; font-size: 30pt;">Fushimi Inari Taisha – Kyoto’s Mesmerizing Trail of 10,000 Torii Gates</h1>

    <img src="../../../img/attractions/fushimi-inari.jpg" alt="Fushimi Inari red torii gates pathway in Kyoto" style="border-radius:16px; width:50%; height:auto; max-width:450px; display:block; margin: 2rem auto;">

    <p style="font-size: 1.1rem; line-height: 1.8;">
      <b>Fushimi Inari Taisha</b> (伏見稲荷大社) is one of Japan’s most iconic and photogenic landmarks, famous worldwide for its thousands of bright red torii gates that wind up the sacred Mount Inari in southern Kyoto. It’s a magical place where <b>Shinto spirituality, nature, and ancient tradition</b> converge in stunning visual harmony.
    </p>

    <h2 style="color:#ff3399;">A Shrine Devoted to Inari – God of Rice and Prosperity</h2>
    <p>
      Founded as early as 711 AD, Fushimi Inari is the head shrine of over 30,000 Inari shrines across Japan. Inari is the Shinto deity of rice, agriculture, business, and industry. Over the centuries, merchants and individuals have donated <b>vermillion torii gates</b> in gratitude for prosperity and good fortune — resulting in the stunning <b>Senbon Torii</b> ("Thousands of Torii") trail.
    </p>

    <h2 style="color:#ff3399;">Meet the Fox Spirits (Kitsune)</h2>
    <p>
      Guarding every shrine and gateway, you’ll notice <b>stone fox statues (kitsune)</b> — messengers of Inari. Often holding a key or jewel in their mouth, they are mystical figures believed to possess supernatural wisdom and the ability to ward off evil. Their watchful eyes follow visitors along the trail, adding to the spiritual atmosphere.
    </p>

    <h2 style="color:#ff3399;">The Legendary Torii Path Hike</h2>
    <p>
      The full hike to the summit of Mount Inari takes about 2–3 hours round trip. Along the way, you’ll pass <b>small sub-shrines, mossy stone lanterns, and panoramic viewpoints of Kyoto</b>. For those short on time, the lower section of torii gates — the most photographed part — can be enjoyed within 30 minutes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Best times to visit are <b>early morning</b> or <b>late afternoon</b>, when the crowds are lighter and the golden light filters magically through the gates.
    </p>

      Fushimi Inari has inspired countless works of Japanese art, film, and literature. Its symbolic red gates represent the threshold between the human and spiritual worlds. The shrine features in movies like <em>Memoirs of a Geisha</em> and continues to be a <b>must-visit site on every Japan travel itinerary</b>.
