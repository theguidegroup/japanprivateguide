      Kiyomizu-dera (Ê∏ÖÊ∞¥ÂØ∫), officially named Otowa-san Kiyomizu-dera, is one of Kyoto‚Äôs most iconic and beloved temples.

      The temple was originally established over 1,200 years ago and is dedicated to Kannon, the goddess of mercy. Kiyomizu-dera‚Äôs name literally means ‚ÄúPure Water Temple,‚Äù deriving from the Otowa Waterfall that flows beneath the main hall. Pilgrims and visitors have long believed in the waterfall‚Äôs sacred waters, which are divided into three streams believed to grant longevity, success, and love.
