    <p style="font-size: 1.1rem; line-height: 1.8;">
      One of Japan’s most iconic and revered monuments, the <strong>Kamakura Daibutsu</strong> (鎌倉大仏) stands proudly at 13.35 meters tall, gazing peacefully over the ancient coastal city of <strong>Kamakura</strong>. This majestic bronze statue of <strong>Amida Buddha</strong> has watched over pilgrims and travelers for centuries, embodying serenity, strength, and the spirit of Japanese Buddhism.
    </p>

    <h2 style="color:#ff3399;">A Testament to Faith and Craftsmanship</h2>
    <p>
      Constructed in the mid-13th century, around <strong>1252</strong>, the Kamakura Daibutsu was originally housed in a grand wooden hall. However, repeated typhoons and tsunamis destroyed the structure—yet the statue remained, enduring the elements under open skies for over 500 years. This resilience has made it a powerful symbol of impermanence and enlightenment in Zen philosophy.
    </p>

    <h2 style="color:#ff3399;">Design and Scale That Inspire Awe</h2>
    <p>
      Cast in bronze using advanced techniques of the Kamakura period, the statue weighs approximately <strong>121 tons</strong> and remains hollow inside, allowing visitors to actually step into the heart of the Buddha. Its calm facial expression, gently folded hands, and flowing robes are masterfully sculpted, exuding peace and divine presence.
    </p>

    <h2 style="color:#ff3399;">Kamakura: Where Nature Meets History</h2>
    <p>
      Located at <strong>Kōtoku-in Temple</strong>, the Kamakura Daibutsu is nestled amid wooded hills and close to the sea, making it a perfect destination for spiritual reflection and natural beauty. It's a <strong>popular day trip from Tokyo</strong>, offering visitors a chance to escape the city's buzz and walk the ancient paths once used by samurai and monks alike.
