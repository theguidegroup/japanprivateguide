    <img src="../../../img/attractions/itsukushima-shrine.jpg" alt="Floating Torii Gate at Itsukushima Shrine on Miyajima Island" style="border-radius:16px; width:50%; height:auto; max-width:450px; display:block; margin: 2rem auto;">

    <p style="font-size: 1.1rem; line-height: 1.8;">
      Rising gracefully from the waters of Hiroshima Bay, <b>Itsukushima Shrine</b> (厳島神社) on <b>Miyajima Island</b> is one of Japan’s most visually stunning and spiritually revered sites. Best known for its iconic vermilion <b>floating torii gate</b>, this Shinto shrine has captivated travelers for centuries with its unique architecture, sacred status, and breathtaking natural setting.
    </p>

    <h2 style="color:#ff3399;">A Sacred Island and Shrine in Harmony</h2>
    <p>
      Originally constructed in the <b>6th century</b> and redesigned in its current form in <b>1168</b> by the powerful warlord Taira no Kiyomori, Itsukushima Shrine was built to honor the daughters of the sea deity <b>Susanoo-no-Mikoto</b>. Because the island itself is considered sacred, the shrine was uniquely built on stilts over the sea, allowing worshippers to approach without setting foot on the hallowed ground.
    </p>

    <h2 style="color:#ff3399;">The Floating Torii Gate – A Symbol of Japan</h2>
    <p>
      Standing over <b>16 meters</b> tall, the massive torii gate appears to float during high tide, creating a mystical and unforgettable silhouette against the horizon. At low tide, visitors can walk directly to its base. This interplay with the sea reflects the Shinto reverence for nature, and the gate has become one of the most recognized symbols of Japan.
    </p>

    <h2 style="color:#ff3399;">UNESCO World Heritage and Cultural Significance</h2>
    <p>
      In <b>1996</b>, Itsukushima Shrine was designated a <b>UNESCO World Heritage Site</b>, recognizing its historical, spiritual, and architectural value. The shrine’s bold vermilion colors are thought to ward off evil spirits, while its open corridors and floating stage embody classical Heian-era design.
    </p>

    <h2 style="color:#ff3399;">Miyajima: More Than a Shrine</h2>
    <p>
      The island of Miyajima, often called “<b>Island of the Gods</b>,” offers more than just the shrine. Stroll through charming streets lined with <b>Momiji Manju</b> shops (maple-leaf shaped sweets), encounter friendly wild deer, or hike up <b>Mount Misen</b> for panoramic views of the Seto Inland Sea. As dusk falls, the torii is lit, casting a magical glow across the water.
