    <p style="font-size: 1.1rem; line-height: 1.8;">
      Hidden behind towering torii gates and surrounded by a vast man-made forest in bustling Harajuku, <strong>Meiji Shrine</strong> (明治神宮, Meiji Jingū) is Tokyo’s most sacred Shinto shrine and a peaceful escape from city life. Dedicated to <strong>Emperor Meiji and Empress Shōken</strong>, the shrine symbolizes Japan’s transition from feudal isolation to modern nationhood — blending ancient rituals with imperial legacy.
    </p>

    <h2 style="color:#ff3399;">A Shrine Born from Imperial Reverence</h2>
    <p>
      Completed in <strong>1920</strong>, Meiji Shrine honors the deified spirits (not the physical remains) of <strong>Emperor Meiji</strong, Japan’s first modern emperor, and his consort, <strong>Empress Shōken</strong>. Emperor Meiji presided over the Meiji Restoration, a critical turning point that transformed Japan into a global power through modernization and cultural fusion.
    </p>
    <p>
      Following their deaths, the Japanese people sought a spiritual site to commemorate their contributions. The result was not just a shrine, but a sacred forest designed to last for generations. Over <strong>100,000 trees</strong> were donated from across Japan and planted to create the now-lush <strong>Meiji Jingu Forest</strong> — a living memorial embodying harmony between nature and Shinto beliefs.
    </p>

    <h2 style="color:#ff3399;">Highlights and Sacred Rituals</h2>
    <p>
      Visitors enter Meiji Shrine through the imposing <strong>Otorii gate</strong>, one of Japan’s largest wooden torii structures. As you pass beneath, tradition suggests bowing once to show respect before entering sacred ground.
    </p>
    <p>
      Along the approach, you’ll find <strong>barrels of sake and wine</strong>, offerings symbolizing cultural fusion — sake from all over Japan, and wine from France, reflecting Emperor Meiji’s embrace of international openness. Near the inner sanctuary, visitors can perform a traditional cleansing ritual at the <strong>temizuya</strong> water basin.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <strong>Main Shrine Building</strong> (Honden) is a place for prayer, offerings, and wedding ceremonies. You may witness <strong>Shinto weddings</strong> here — a stunning cultural experience featuring white-clad brides, priests in ceremonial robes, and traditional court music.
    </p>

    <h2 style="color:#ff3399;">Seasonal Beauty and Quiet Escapes</h2>
    <p>
      Meiji Shrine is beautiful in every season — from blooming cherry blossoms in spring, to verdant summer greens, golden leaves in autumn, and peaceful snowfall in winter. Despite being in central Tokyo, the shrine feels miles away from urban noise, thanks to the dense forest and gravel paths that hush the outside world.
    </p>
    <p>
      A visit to Meiji Shrine is often paired with a stroll through nearby <strong>Yoyogi Park</strong> or shopping in <strong>Harajuku</strong>, showcasing Tokyo’s perfect balance of ancient spirit and modern energy.
