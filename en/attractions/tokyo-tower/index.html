      Tokyo Tower (東京タワー), completed in 1958, is one of Japan’s most famous landmarks and a symbol of Tokyo’s post-war rebirth and modernization. Standing at 333 meters (1,093 feet), it was the tallest structure in Japan until the completion of Tokyo Skytree in 2012. Its distinctive red and white lattice structure is instantly recognizable and draws millions of visitors annually.

      Inspired by the Eiffel Tower in Paris, Tokyo Tower was built as a communications and broadcasting tower to support Japan’s rapidly growing TV and radio industries. Beyond its practical use, it became a cultural icon featured in countless films, anime, and artworks, symbolizing Tokyo’s resilience and technological progress during the Showa era.
