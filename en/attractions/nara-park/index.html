    <p style="font-size: 1.1rem; line-height: 1.8;">
      Situated in the heart of Nara City, <b>Nara Park</b> (奈良公園) is one of Japan’s most beloved and culturally rich public parks. Famous for its large population of freely roaming <b>sacred deer</b> — considered messengers of the Shinto gods — the park offers visitors a unique blend of natural beauty, historical temples, and vibrant cultural experiences.
    </p>

    <h2 style="color:#ff3399;">A Park Steeped in History and Spirituality</h2>
    <p>
      Established in 1880, Nara Park surrounds some of Japan’s most important historic landmarks, including the UNESCO World Heritage-listed <b>Todai-ji Temple</b>, home to the giant bronze Great Buddha statue (<em>Daibutsu</em>). The park's landscape, dotted with centuries-old temples, shrines, and museums, reflects Japan’s deep cultural and religious traditions.

    <h2 style="color:#ff3399;">The Sacred Deer of Nara</h2>
    <p>
      The <b>sika deer</b> in Nara Park are not just local wildlife; they are protected as national treasures and roam freely across the park grounds. Visitors can buy special deer crackers called <em>shika senbei</em> to feed and interact with these friendly creatures, creating unforgettable moments. The deer’s gentle presence symbolizes harmony between nature and humanity in Shinto belief.
    </p>
