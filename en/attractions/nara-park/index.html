    <p style="font-size: 1.1rem; line-height: 1.8;">
      Situated in the heart of Nara City, <strong>Nara Park</strong> (å¥ˆè‰¯å…¬åœ’) is one of Japanâ€™s most beloved and culturally rich public parks. Famous for its large population of freely roaming <strong>sacred deer</strong> â€” considered messengers of the Shinto gods â€” the park offers visitors a unique blend of natural beauty, historical temples, and vibrant cultural experiences.
    </p>

    <h2 style="color:#ff3399;">A Park Steeped in History and Spirituality</h2>
    <p>
      Established in 1880, Nara Park surrounds some of Japanâ€™s most important historic landmarks, including the UNESCO World Heritage-listed <strong>Todai-ji Temple</strong>, home to the giant bronze Great Buddha statue (<em>Daibutsu</em>). The park's landscape, dotted with centuries-old temples, shrines, and museums, reflects Japanâ€™s deep cultural and religious traditions.

    <h2 style="color:#ff3399;">The Sacred Deer of Nara</h2>
    <p>
      The <strong>sika deer</strong> in Nara Park are not just local wildlife; they are protected as national treasures and roam freely across the park grounds. Visitors can buy special deer crackers called <em>shika senbei</em> to feed and interact with these friendly creatures, creating unforgettable moments. The deerâ€™s gentle presence symbolizes harmony between nature and humanity in Shinto belief.
