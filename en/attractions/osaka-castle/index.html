    <img src="img/attractions/osaka-castle.jpg" alt="Osaka Castle with cherry blossoms" width="900px" height="auto;" style="border-radius:16px; width:100%; height:auto; max-width:900px; display:block; margin: 2rem auto;" />

    <p style="font-size: 1.1rem; line-height: 1.8;">
      Towering above the city skyline with emerald-green rooftops and gold accents, <strong>Osaka Castle</strong> (大阪城, Ōsaka-jō) is more than just a beautiful landmark — it is the very heart of Japan’s samurai legacy. Built in the late 16th century by the legendary warlord <strong>Toyotomi Hideyoshi</strong>, this fortress played a pivotal role in unifying Japan and shaping the nation’s destiny.
    </p>

    <h2 style="color:#ff3399;">A Castle Born from Ambition</h2>
    <p>
      Constructed in <strong>1583</strong>, Osaka Castle was the grand symbol of Toyotomi Hideyoshi’s rise from humble origins to become one of Japan’s "Great Unifiers." Designed to be the most imposing castle of its time, it featured revolutionary defensive walls, moats, and towers. Hideyoshi's ambition was clear — to show power, sophistication, and divine rule.
    </p>
    <p>
      Although destroyed and rebuilt multiple times throughout history — including during the fall of the Toyotomi clan and World War II — the castle was painstakingly restored and now stands as a proud emblem of resilience and cultural preservation.
    </p>

    <h2 style="color:#ff3399;">Step into the World of Samurai</h2>
    <p>
      The present-day <strong>main tower</strong> is a modern reconstruction with a museum inside, offering stunning panoramic views from the top and immersive exhibits inside. Learn about the Sengoku ("Warring States") period, the rise and fall of feudal clans, and the personal life of Hideyoshi himself — through samurai armor, historical scrolls, weaponry, and video installations.
    </p>
    <p>
      Surrounding the castle is a vast park with moats, stone walls, cherry blossom trees, and <strong>Nishinomaru Garden</strong> — a peaceful retreat that bursts into pink during spring hanami season.
    </p>

    <h2 style="color:#ff3399;">Cultural Highlights and Events</h2>
    <p>
      Osaka Castle regularly hosts traditional <strong>Japanese festivals</strong>, reenactments, and martial arts events. During spring and autumn, the grounds come alive with lanterns, food stalls, and performances that reflect the grandeur of Japan’s warrior culture.
    </p>
    <p>
      For photographers and culture lovers, the contrast of ancient castle architecture against Osaka’s modern skyline creates breathtaking visual moments.
