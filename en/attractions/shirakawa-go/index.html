      <strong>Shirakawa-go</strong> (白川郷) is a UNESCO World Heritage-listed village located in the remote mountains of Gifu Prefecture, Japan.

    <p>
      The most iconic feature of Shirakawa-go is its traditional <strong>gassho-zukuri</strong> farmhouses, known for their steep, thatched roofs that resemble hands pressed together in prayer ("gassho"). These structures are designed to withstand heavy snowfall in the region’s harsh winters and have been passed down through generations for over 250 years.

      Shirakawa-go is made up of several small hamlets, the most famous being <strong>Ogimachi</strong>.
