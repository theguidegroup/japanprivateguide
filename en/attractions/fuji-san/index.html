    <p style="font-size: 1.1rem; line-height: 1.8;">
      Rising majestically to 3,776 meters, <strong>Mount Fuji</strong> (å¯Œå£«å±±, Fujisan) is not only Japanâ€™s tallest mountain â€” itâ€™s a national icon, spiritual sanctuary, and a world-renowned symbol of harmony between nature and humanity. Perfectly symmetrical, eternally snow-capped, and steeped in mythology, Mount Fuji has inspired <strong>poets, pilgrims, painters, and adventurers</strong> for over a thousand years.
    </p>

    <h2 style="color:#ff3399;">A UNESCO World Heritage Site & Sacred Peak</h2>
    <p>
      Designated as a <strong>UNESCO Cultural World Heritage Site</strong> in 2013, Mount Fuji is revered not just for its natural beauty, but also as a deeply spiritual place. Since the 7th century, pilgrims have journeyed to its summit seeking purification and enlightenment. Shrines dot its base, trails are lined with stone markers, and the climb itself is seen as a metaphor for lifeâ€™s personal journey.
    </p>

    <h2 style="color:#ff3399;">Climbing Mount Fuji â€“ A Bucket List Adventure</h2>
    <p>
      Climbing Mount Fuji is a <strong>once-in-a-lifetime experience</strong>. The official climbing season runs from early July to early September, when mountain huts and safety services operate. Choose between four main trails â€” <strong>Yoshida</strong>, <strong>Subashiri</strong>, <strong>Gotemba</strong>, and <strong>Fujinomiya</strong> â€” each offering unique views and challenges.
    </p>
    <p>
      Many climbers begin at night to reach the summit by dawn, witnessing the awe-inspiring <strong>Goraiko</strong> (sunrise) from above the clouds. The memory of this spiritual moment stays with travelers forever.
    </p>

    <h2 style="color:#ff3399;">The Fuji Five Lakes Region</h2>
    <p>
      At the northern foot of Mount Fuji lies the <strong>Fuji Five Lakes (Fujigoko)</strong> â€” including Lake Kawaguchi, Lake Yamanaka, and Lake Motosu â€” each offering spectacular views, hot springs, hiking trails, and traditional ryokans. These areas are perfect for visitors who want to admire Fujiâ€™s beauty without climbing, with panoramic photo opportunities in every direction.
    </p>

    <h2 style="color:#ff3399;">Culture, Art, and Legend</h2>
    <p>
      Mount Fuji has long been a muse for artists and writers. It features prominently in <strong>Ukiyo-e woodblock prints</strong>, especially Hokusaiâ€™s "Thirty-Six Views of Mount Fuji". Itâ€™s also a central subject in ancient Shinto beliefs, where it is considered the home of a mountain kami (deity). Even today, its form is seen as a symbol of perfection, resilience, and transcendence.
