    <img src="img/attractions/tokyo-skytree.jpg" alt="Tokyo Skytree tower lit up at night in Tokyo" width="500" height="500" style="border-radius:16px; width:100%; max-width:500px; display:block; margin: 2rem auto;" />

    <p style="font-size: 1.1rem; line-height: 1.8;">
      Tokyo Skytree (東京スカイツリー) stands as the tallest structure in Japan and the second tallest tower in the world, soaring to a staggering height of 634 meters (2,080 feet). Completed in 2012, it has rapidly become one of Tokyo’s most iconic landmarks and a must-visit destination for travelers seeking panoramic city views, modern architecture, and a blend of culture and entertainment.

    <h2 style="color:#ff3399;">Architectural Marvel and Engineering Feat</h2>
    <p>
      Designed with cutting-edge earthquake-resistant technology, Tokyo Skytree incorporates traditional Japanese aesthetics with modern engineering excellence. The tower’s height of 634 meters was carefully chosen because the numbers “6-3-4” can be read as “Mu-Sha-Shi,” a historical name for the Tokyo region. The sleek, futuristic design symbolizes Japan’s blend of tradition and innovation.
    </p>

    <h2 style="color:#ff3399;">Observation Decks with Spectacular Views</h2>
    <p>
      Tokyo Skytree features two main observation decks: the Tembo Deck at 350 meters and the Tembo Galleria at 450 meters. Visitors are treated to breathtaking 360-degree views that stretch across Tokyo’s sprawling metropolis, including landmarks such as Tokyo Tower, Tokyo Bay, and on clear days, even Mount Fuji. The glass-floored Skywalk offers an exhilarating experience for thrill-seekers.
    </p>

    <h2 style="color:#ff3399;">Entertainment, Shopping, and Dining</h2>
    <p>
      The base of the tower houses Tokyo Solamachi, a large shopping complex with over 300 shops, restaurants, and an aquarium. From traditional Japanese cuisine to international dishes, visitors can indulge in diverse flavors while enjoying views of the tower itself. Seasonal events, light shows, and cultural exhibitions enrich the visitor experience throughout the year.
    </p>

    <h2 style="color:#ff3399;">Access and Visitor Tips</h2>
