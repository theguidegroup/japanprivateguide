    <p style="font-size: 1.1rem; line-height: 1.8;">
      <strong>Kinkaku-ji</strong> (金閣寺), officially known as Rokuon-ji, is one of Kyoto’s most breathtaking and iconic landmarks. Also known as the <strong>Golden Pavilion Temple</strong>, this Zen Buddhist temple shimmers with real gold leaf, reflected perfectly on the serene waters of its surrounding pond. A visit to Kinkaku-ji is like stepping into a Japanese postcard—timeless, elegant, and deeply spiritual.
    </p>

    <h2 style="color:#ff3399;">A Temple Rooted in History and Power</h2>
    <p>
      Built in <strong>1397</strong> during the Muromachi period, Kinkaku-ji was originally the retirement villa of Shogun Ashikaga Yoshimitsu. Upon his death, the villa was converted into a Zen temple affiliated with the Rinzai sect of Buddhism. It symbolized both political power and spiritual enlightenment—a rare blend of beauty and authority.
    </p>

    <h2 style="color:#ff3399;">Dazzling Golden Architecture</h2>
    <p>
      The temple’s top two floors are entirely covered in <strong>pure gold leaf</strong>, which sparkles brilliantly under the sun. It’s built in three distinct architectural styles: the Shinden style on the first floor, the samurai Bukke style on the second, and the Zen temple style on the top. Each layer reflects a different era and philosophy of Japanese aesthetics.
    </p>

    <p>
      Sitting beside <strong>Kyōko-chi</strong> (“Mirror Pond”), the structure’s reflection in the still water doubles its magnificence—creating one of the most photographed views in all of Japan.
    </p>

    <h2 style="color:#ff3399;">Fire, Rebirth, and Preservation</h2>
    <p>
      Kinkaku-ji has endured tragedy. In 1950, it was set on fire by a novice monk and completely destroyed. The current structure was rebuilt in <strong>1955</strong> with careful attention to historical accuracy and greater fire resistance. It remains a powerful symbol of impermanence and resilience—core principles of Buddhist belief.
    </p>

    <h2 style="color:#ff3399;">World Cultural Heritage Status</h2>
    <p>
      Recognized by UNESCO as a <strong>World Cultural Heritage Site</strong>, Kinkaku-ji is not only a sacred temple but a cultural treasure of Japan. Its elegant design, tranquil gardens, and philosophical depth attract over 5 million visitors annually.
