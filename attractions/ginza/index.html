      Beyond its glittering storefronts, Ginza offers deep cultural roots. Once the site of a 17th-century silver mint (hence the name “Ginza”), the district still retains its connection to art and refinement. Visit the <strong>Kabuki-za Theatre</strong> to witness authentic Japanese Kabuki performances, or explore modern exhibitions at the <strong>Shiseido Gallery</strong> and <strong>Tokyo Gallery</strong>.
